"""
Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but
 lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
 The Template Method pattern suggests that you break down an algorithm into a series of steps, turn these steps
  into methods, and put a series of calls to these methods inside a single template method.
  The steps may either be abstract, or have some default implementation. To use the algorithm, the client is
  supposed to provide its own subclass, implement all abstract steps, and override some of the optional ones if needed.

  As you can see, weâ€™ve got two types of steps:

    abstract steps must be implemented by every subclass
    optional steps already have some default implementation, but still can be overridden if needed

Use the Template Method pattern when you want to let clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm,
but not the whole algorithm or its structure.
