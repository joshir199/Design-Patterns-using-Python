"""
Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects.
The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via mediator object.

The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct communication between the components which you
want to make independent of each other. Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, by calling a special
mediator object that redirects the calls to appropriate components. As a result, the components depend only on a
 single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their colleagues.

 The difference between Mediator and Observer is often elusive. In most cases, you can implement either of these
 patterns; but sometimes you can apply both simultaneously. Letâ€™s see how we can do that.
