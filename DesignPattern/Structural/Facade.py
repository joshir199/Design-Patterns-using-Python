"""
Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or
any other complex set of classes.

// There will be some of the classes of a complex 3rd-party video
// conversion framework. We don't control that code, therefore
// can't simplify it.

// We create a facade class to hide the framework's complexity
// behind a simple interface. It's a trade-off between
// functionality and simplicity.

Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
facade interface makes the client code independent of many of the subsystemâ€™s classes.
The subsystem itself is unaware of the facade.
